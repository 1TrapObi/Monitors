# Sneaker Monitors: Shopify 

These monitors require you to find the json webpage with all the products listed.
We would start by locating the path we want to monitor.

For example, for the Hanon Shop, if we want to monitor new items, we would go to the following address: ```https://www.hanon-shop/collections/whats-new```.
To get all the items on this page in a json format, we add ```/products.json``` at the end.
This gives us the following address: ```https://www.hanon-shop/collections/whats-new/products.json```.

Change and add that as the url at the bottom of the script for any path on a Shopify store.
