## About the Project
This project is aimed at providing web-monitors for various sites to the sneaker community for free. 
The monitors currently notify if a restock or release occurs via Discord Webhook.
Today, competition to purchase sneakers is getting increasingly difficult with resellers using paid automated tools to give them a massive advantage over everyone else.
As such, I have and will continue to develop monitors that will help those members that struggle to finally get the sneakers they want.

This project is continually expanding, and I would greatly appreciate any contributions. 
When contributing please fork the project and open a Pull Request.

However, due to popular demand, I am developing a paid (but competitively priced) set of hosted monitors. These will be released on my Discord Server that you can join in [#Contact](#Contact).

To install the dependencies, use the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Steps

1. First perform the installation described in [#Installation](#installation).

2. Clone or Download the repository
    - Clone:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yasserqureshi1/Sneaker-Monitors.git
    ```
    - Download: Click on the green `Code` button and click on `Download ZIP`. Then unzip this folder
    
3. Start editting the `.env` file to your specifications. You will only be interacting with the ```.env``` file.
    - **Add Webhook**: Paste your Discord Webhook URL under the `WEBHOOK` variable. It should look like this:
    ```
    WEBHOOK = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
    ```
    - (Optional) **Add Proxy**: Paste your proxy under the `PROXY` variable. There are two structures:

        1. ```PROXY = "<proxy>:<port>"``` 
        2. ```PROXY = "<proxy_username>:<proxy_password>@<proxy_domain>:<port>"```
    - You can also edit other details within the `.env` file as you see fit

4. Run the Python file. You can use the following command:
  ```
  python [file name].py
  ```

**NOTE:** The script needs to be running continuously for it to keep monitoring websites. As such, you should host it on a server. I have a YouTube tutorial on this [here](https://youtu.be/nmUSSlt4JKk). However, I suggest testing this out on your PC before using a server.


## Issues

If you find an issue, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/yasserqureshi1/Sneaker-Monitors/issues/new). 
I will respond fairly quickly and try to come up with solution.

I may ask you to provide the log file that is produced by the monitor.
It contains no personal data but may help me diagnose where the issue arises.
